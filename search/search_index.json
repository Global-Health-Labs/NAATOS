International resolutions, like the World Health Assembly Resolution 76.5,<sup>3</sup> and initiatives, like the Africa Collaborative Initiative to Advance Diagnostics (AFCAD),<sup>4</sup> aim to strengthen diagnostic capacity, promote local manufacturing, and harmonize regulatory processes, particularly in low-income countries<sup>5</sup>. But to realize these targets globally, a sustainable and resilient ecosystem of regional research and product development must exist in LMICs to ensure health priorities are met locally.<sup>6</sup> This approach is essential to build resilience in healthcare systems and to foster a responsive and self-sufficient local industry capable of addressing global health threats.</p> <p>Global Health Labs (GHL) was a non-profit organization that from 2020 to 2025 created and de-risked innovative health technologies with the ultimate goal of enabling manufacturing and commercialization partners to make them available at the point of need. One product of GHL is NAATOS, Nucleic Acid Amplification Test On a Strip. NAATOS is a novel diagnostic platform conceived at GHL that integrates Nucleic Acid Amplification Test (NAAT) and Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) technologies to empower primary health care and diagnostic ecosystems with tests that are sensitive, specific, affordable, easy-to-use, and available.</p> <p>NAATs are the gold standard for sensitivity and specificity in diagnostics, but their success depends on expensive lab infrastructure (e.g., reliable power, environmental controls, equipment maintenance) that is cost-prohibitive for PHC settings, most of which have only basic lab capabilities. LFAs bridge this gap by offering a low-cost and easy-to-use alternative that can be locally produced and readily deployed at the point of care in PHC, but LFAs lack the sensitivity and specificity of NAATs.

The test device comprises a laminate housing, which is converted from plastic and adhesive sheets or rolls and pressed together into upper and lower laminate subcomponents; and a lateral flow strip, which is assembled from several porous materials, some of which have been modified with buffers and/or dried with biochemical reagents. The manufacturing sequence provides that the lateral flow strip subcomponent and the upper and lower laminate housing subcomponents are combined in a final assembly step to create the test device.</p> <ul> <li>The test device consists of a specialized lateral flow assay (LFA) strip and a laminated housing.</li> <li>The LFA strip provides several functionalities: sample metering, fluid transport via capillary flow, amplification and detection reagent dry storage, automated two-step valved transfer from amplification to detection, and a diagnostic readout. These functionalities are enabled by various treated and untreated porous materials used\u2014in order from upstream to downstream\u2014as distributer, amplification, wax valve, conjugate, analytical, and waste pads.</li> <li>The distributor pad is placed upstream of and overlaps the amplification pad. It provides a low-resistance flow medium to transport the fluid sample out of the sample well and up to the wax valve then down into the amplification pad. The transport speed in the distributor pad is greater than in the amplification pad, where the latter is affected by the excipients used to dry the amplification reagents in the amplification pad. This phenomenon causes the sample to preferentially wet the entire distributor pad before flowing down to wet the entire amplification pad from above, improving the uniformity of reagent rehydration in the amplification pad.</li> <li>The amplification pad contains the dry amplification reagents, including an Internal Positive Control (IPC), and is the location for the loop-mediated amplification (LAMP) reaction. During amplification, the PM heats the amplification pad and wax valve pad to the amplification temperature of 65 \u00b0C.</li> <li>The wax valve pad contains a solid stripe of casting wax deposited by striping melted wax on two sides of the wax valve pad material and reflowing the double-striped valve in an oven. After amplification, the PM rapidly heats the wax valve to 90 \u00b0C, which melts the valve such that the liquid amplification reaction flows downstream to the test lines. The wax valve requires both a minimum temperature to actuate as well as a minimum input power level. Low input power levels reduce performance by allowing partial melting that reduces downstream flow performance.</li> <li>The conjugate pad contains one of the dry detection reagents. This reagent is the blue latex nanoparticle and anti-FITC antibody conjugate that visibly labels the amplification reaction product.</li> <li>The analytical pad enables visual interpretation of the assay, and include a test line, internal positive control line, and flow control line. These lines contain the rest of the dry detection reagents, which capture the amplification reaction product stemming from the target nucleic acid sequence (i.e., Mtb IS6110 and IS1080 genome sites), the amplification reaction product stemming from the IPC (i.e., a plasmid containing a partial sequence of the EF-1\u03b1 gene from Valsa mali, a fungal apple pathogen), and unbound conjugates, respectively.</li> <li>The waste pad accepts all fluid transported through the analytical pad, which allows for clearance of uncaptured conjugate from the analytical pad, enabling easier visual interpretation.</li> <li>The laminated housing provides the mechanical structure to enable error-free introduction of prepared sample, to hold the LFA strip, to seal the amplification reaction behind the wax valve, to allow air recirculation during detection, and to provide a biosafe enclosure. The laminate is made of interlaid layers of plastic sheeting and pressure sensitive adhesives, which convert 2D sections into a 3D layout that implements these functions.</li> <li>The sample introduction zone contains a plastic tab above a backed adhesive seal with an inlet port, which is terminated by a positive stop feature within a sample well that guides fluid into the upstream end (i.e., distributor pad) of the LFA. The inlet port is only slightly larger than the dispensing end of the dropper tube to minimize the risk of sample escaping the test device during sample introduction from the dropper tube to the test device.</li> <li>The amplification zone is tight to the LFA to discourage capillary flow out of the amplification zone. The lowest layer of the laminate is designed to allow efficient heat transfer to the amplification zone and wax valve.</li> <li>The wax valve zone is tight to the wax valve in the LFA to enable a complete fluidic seal during amplification. Small indentations into the sides of the wax valve, slight compression above the wax valve, and a spring arm to one side of the wax valve help to create the seal during installation of the LFA into the laminate housing during final assembly of the test device.</li> <li>The venting system includes a recirculating vent, which prevents an air spring from forming downstream of the wax valve that could impede flow during detection, and a hydrophobic barrier to prevent liquid from blocking the air channel, which takes the form of a mesh of ~100\u2013200 \u00b5m holes on a spacing of ~400 \u00b5m such that the surface tension of the liquid prevents it from wicking into the vent.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"TB-V1/overview/#power-module-pm","title":"Power Module (PM)","text":"<p>A reusable, custom, portable instrument for running test consumable loaded with prepared sample by providing heating and timing.</p> <p>The PM design is intended to minimize overall system cost of a thermal control system for operating assay steps in the test device.

Module configuration needs Single and two-test module systems would be sufficient for clinics visited. Battery operated devices Rechargeable battery solutions essential since there is limited back-up power and on the odd occasion, long periods of power outages. Module battery life indicator Add a clear battery life indicator (battery icon) to keep users informed about remaining power levels. Module instrument labeling Require clear labeling of lights &amp; user-friendly solution influenced by UI/UX design. Securing devices in facilities With the potential for theft, the instruments should have an ability to be secured to a counter or table within the clinic environment. Quick turnaround time Quick turnaround time is crucial to ensure testing is completed within the same clinical encounter, reducing patient wait times, improving TB case follow-up, and minimizing the need for additional modules to support high-traffic urban clinics. Test Consumable Control lines understanding Explore options to visually guide users to read both control lines as one, such as minimizing the space between C1 and C2 or using a wash-away design. Provide clear quick reference guides and basic training to help non-laboratory users confidently interpret the two control lines and one test line. Contamination risks NAATOS cartridges need a secure design to prevent contamination during disposal, due to potential incineration or off-site dumping. Interfering substances There were concerns about alcohol and drug use potentially affecting test accuracy, and further investigation is recommended during the usability testing phase. Abstaining from food and drink WHO recommends abstaining from food and drink 30 minutes before testing. Usability testing should assess the impact of this waiting period on clinic workflows and patient compliance. Sample Preparation Module Sample module lid Redesign the sample module lid to be easier to locate and open, possibly with visual cues or ergonomic design improvements Tube insertion guidance Implement a mechanism or visual guide to ensure users insert the tube fully, allowing the sample prep module to close properly Power Module Test device insertion point Redesign the interface to make the insertion point for the test device more intuitive and easier to locate. Correct test device insertion Implement a mechanism or visual guide to ensure the test device is inserted correctly to prevent incorrect insertion. Connectivity Connectivity an add-on feature With majority of data management being paperwork for the clinic, but there being a strong element of electronic record keeping for monthly national reporting, connectivity should be a supplementary feature, with integration into national TB programs and centralized lab data systems. Consider alternative communication strategies Connectivity solutions would work well where results can be shared via SMS to facilitate robust client communication and ownership of their own results. Sample Collection Kit Contamination risks Design modifications (e.g., wider base for sample tubes) could reduce spillage risks. Proper training on sample handling is crucial to minimize contamination risks. Observations included practices like placing tubes on their sides when open. Recommended Placement Placement and users The NAATOS device is ideally suited for Level 2 &amp; 3 facilities in Kenya and PHC and CHC facilities in South Africa, which typically handle moderate patient volumes and are equipped with trained healthcare workers capable of operating diagnostic equipment. These facilities provide a balance between resource availability and high patient need. This will help reduce the reliance on sample logistics for TB tests that enable same day linkage to care. Triage/observation/vitals room Placing the device in the triage room ensures early TB testing as soon as TB symptom screening questionnaire is done with the client, aligning with current symptom assessments and helping reduce transmission risk Centralized testing area For centralized access, a dedicated testing area within the facility would enable nurses or clinical officers to efficiently manage testing away from patient traffic, facilitating a smoother workflow. Primary Users of NAATOS Primary users Nurses, clinical officers, community health workers, and in rare cases, lab technicians, will be the main users of the device. These professionals often manage multiple responsibilities and face challenges, such as sample handling and a lack of timely access to test results. User Needs - ease of use Users prefer minimal setup and simple instructions, particularly in facilities where multiple staff share responsibility for TB testing. User Needs - quick results Faster testing and result turnaround are critical to prevent patients from needing multiple clinic visits, which affects adherence and follow-up. User Needs - training and support Users need training on device operation and sample handling to avoid common errors observed during the usability study, such as difficulty with the sample module Target Population for testing with NAATOS TB patients and symptomatic individuals Visiting primary care centers in high TB-burden areas, especially those with limited access to rapid testing. Special population - PLHIV PLHIV and others who can't produce sputum Special population - children Children at each facility children were mentioned as an important population that the tongue swab TB test would help considerably. It is traumatic to for the child and parent to collect samples via gastric aspirate or bronchial lavage, and how they avoided the procedure as much as possible. Household contacts All community health workers asked about using the test for household contacts and taking NAATOS into the community. More would need to be done to explore the feasibility and performance capability for this use case. Benefit to the target population By minimizing turnaround time and patient wait periods, NAATOS could significantly reduce delays in diagnosis, ensuring same day access to treatment and improving the overall patient experience. NAATOS also helps reduce the risk of transmission in waiting areas."},{"location":"V0/overview/","title":"NAATOS V2","text":""},{"location":"V2/overview/","title":"NAATOS V2","text":""}]}
