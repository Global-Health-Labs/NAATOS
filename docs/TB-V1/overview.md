# NAATOS TB V1

The NAATOS TB V1 is a modular diagnostic system comprising:

1. Sample Collection Consumable (SCC), a single-use swab for sampling a dorsal tongue specimen.
2. Sample Tube Tube (SPT), a single-use, squeezable dropper tube for holding sample preparation reagents and swab head during sample preparation, and transferring prepared sample to test consumable.
3. Sample Preparation Module (SPM), a reusable, portable instrument for preparing swab sample in sample tube.
4. Test Consumable (TC), a single-use laminated test cartridge for holding assay reagents and running assay from prepared sample.
5. Power Module (PM), a reusable, portable instrument for running test consumable loaded with prepared sample by providing heating and timing.
